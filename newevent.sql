This is part of the EducationUSA’s International Education Week (IEW) - a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education.\r\n\r\nAbout  Dr. Rekha Srinivasan:\r\n\r\nDr. Rekha Srinivasan is the James S. Swinehart Professorial Teaching Fellow and senior instructor in the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland, OH. She obtained her PhD from CWRU with research focused on biophysical properties of amyloid peptides. Her postdoctoral work in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at CWRU involved the design and synthesis of peptide-decorated drug delivery devices for cardiovascular applications. Dr. Srinivasan has distinguished herself as an outstanding educator and mentor. She has received numerous awards for teaching and mentoring, including the Carl F. Witke Award for Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching, Bruce Jackson Award for Outstanding Undergraduate Mentoring, and Women in Science and Engineering Roundtable Advisor of the Year Award for four consecutive years. Dr. Srinivasan’s current focus involves designing and implementing video-centric, active learning pedagogy in classrooms. She has obtained grants from the Nord Foundation and the American Chemical Society (ACS) to present her educational research on topics such as student attitudes toward blended instruction in biochemistry, active learning videos in lecture courses, student-derived experimental procedures for organic laboratory, and designing curricula for Seminar Approach to General Education in Sciences at the ACS and American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology national meetings. \r\n\r\nAbout the talk: \r\n\r\nTitle: DESIGNING ACTIVE LEARNING CLASSROOM (ALC) for STEMM: A BRIDGE BETWEEN TEACHING AND LEARNING\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nUndergraduate education in India has undergone rapid expansion with the education sector valued at USD $91 billion in 2018. This explosion in the education sector is projected to continue this upward trend with India’s increasing youth population. Dr. Srinivasan’s research project identifies current teaching practices and barriers faced for implementing teaching innovation in host institutions. She is then applying a plan-do-check-act (PDCA cycle) philosophy by mentoring host educators to redesign and implement active learning classrooms. She is assessing the effectiveness of novel methods and repeating the cycle to optimize best teaching practices.    \r\n\r\nThe lecture-discussion is tailored to STEMM (Science - Technology - Engineering - Mathematics - Medicine) Faculty and will include ideas around integrating active learning strategies in the classroom, using some common and simple active learning strategies in teaching and instructional technologies to support the use of active learning.', '2019-11-16', '2019-11-16', NULL, 'PES University RR Campus', 'Workshop,Technical', NULL, '11:00 AM', '12:30 PM', NULL, 'MCA Seminar Hall, Prof. MRD Block, PES University, RR Campus, Bangalore 560085', 'No', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '/Uploads/20191111 102137_STEMM 400X222.jpg', NULL, 'invited-talk-by-dr.-rekha-srinivasan-designing-active-learning-classroom-(alc)-for-stemm:-a-bridge-between-teaching-and-learning', 0, 728, '2019-11-11 10:20:49', '2019-11-11 10:20:49', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, 0, 'Published', 'Yes'),

Sivaranjani (Texas A&M University, USA)', 'Outline: \r\nFluid-like models and their discretisations like the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) have proven successful in modelling traffic networks. However, given the complexity of the dynamics, it is not surprising that the stability properties of these models, especially in congested regimes, are not yet well characterised. The first half of this talk will propose a new modelling paradigm, where an analogy between discretised fluid-like traffic flow models and a class of chemical reaction networks is constructed by suitable relaxations of key conservation laws. This framework allows us to draw upon powerful structural results and entropy-like Lyapunov functions from chemical reaction network theory to study the existence and stability of congested steady states in networks with arbitrary topologies. The second half of this talk will motivate compositional design approaches to mitigate congestion in large-scale transportation networks by describing a scalable distributed design that uses only local information to limit the propagation of congestion in the network.\r\n\r\nSivaranjani is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University. Her research focuses on distributed control of large-scale infrastructure networks, with emphasis on transportation networks and power grids. She obtained her PhD in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame in 2019, and her undergraduate and Master’s degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the PES Institute of Technology, India and the Indian Institute of Science, India in 2011 and 2013 respectively. Sivaranjani has also been a research intern at GE Global Research, Bangalore (2011-13), and a visiting graduate student at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley (2018). She is a recipient of the prestigious international Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future fellowship (2015-2018) and the Zonta International Amelia Earhart fellowship (2015-2016).

(127, 'Technical Talk', 'by Dr Sachin Prabhu, University of Leeds, UK', 'Multiscale Modelling Approach and Application to Natural Systems\r\n\r\nOutline: Typical engineering practice imposes simplifying assumptions on secondary system behaviour for mathematical tractability. In contrast, natural systems exhibit various complex behaviours at different spatio-temporal scales. Whilst modelling individual effects in a natural system is insufficient to develop useful insights into the overall behaviour, developing accurate models for system-wide behaviour is practically impossible. Ensuring mathematical tractability and accuracy requires scale separation to identify effects that can be modelled at individual scales and explore options for bridging knowledge gaps across scales. Such an approach is called multiscale modelling. This systematic approach is rapidly gaining popularity in research related to both engineering and natural systems alike. Multiscale modelling is quickly becoming the go-to method in high impact areas of research such as drug discovery and additive manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture, an overview of multiscale modelling problem and principles of scale-separation, hypo-modelling, and hyper-modelling will be provided, and will include a quick introduction to different flavours of the multiscale problem. Two case studies – transcriptional regulatory network inference and clinical hip fracture risk prediction – will be used to demonstrate the steps involved in defining multiscale problems followed by a discussion on different combinations of traditional methods to obtain meaningful solutions. The lecture will be concluded with an attempt to paint a broader picture of personalised medicine where every aspect of the underlying model from molecular scale to epigenetic scale is tailored to the needs of an individual. \r\n\r\nDr. Sachin Prabhu is with the School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds, where he is involved in several projects spanning industrial and biomedical applications and is presently a co-investigator in research related to monitoring and control of pharmaceutical powder blending process. He obtained his Ph.D. in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK, and worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher prior to joining Leeds. He is an alumnus of Telecommunication Engineering of PES Institute of Technology where he completed his Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems.

We, the CSR club of PESU feel that if the right mindset and concern for the environment is inculcated into the minds of young students, it will go a long way in both, their future and the planet’s. So, we are organizing a cleaning drive for 100 young student volunteers on the 19th of March 2022, at, arguably, the most beautiful and significant garden – park of the city, Lalbagh. The volunteers will be taken to the venue from the college directly. At the venue, the volunteers will be split into groups of 5 and each group would be given the responsibility of spreading awareness to the general public present at that time and also clean their assigned area of Lalbagh, thus making sure that the park looks the best it can. Food and Refreshments will be provided to the volunteers so that they will have the energy to accomplish their tasks more efficiently. The volunteers will also be privy to a talk by the Directors/Officials of Lalbagh.
